Quarteera e. V. â€” is the first nationwide association of Russian-speaking LGBTQ+ migrants in Germany, which has been advocating for the visibility of Russian-speaking LGBTQ+ people in Germany since 2011, particularly among the Russian-speaking population, and promoting awareness of LGBTQ+ issues among Russian-speaking people. Quarteera sees its mission as counteracting the multiple discrimination faced by Russian-speaking LGBTQ+ individuals (due to their origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity).
