Pride consists of a demonstration followed by a street festival at Viktor-Klemperer-Platz, featuring a stage program and numerous booths.

Quarteera e.V. is the organizer of the event. Since 2011, the association has been advocating for the visibility of the Russian-speaking LGBTIQ* community in Germany as well as within the Russian-speaking population.

- Engaging in and participating in a working group for festival organization

**Your Profile:**

- Strong communication skills
