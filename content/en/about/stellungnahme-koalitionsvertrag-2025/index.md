Berlin, April 10, 2025


Germany’s queer community organization Quarteera is watching with concern the Coalition Agreement presented by the CDU/CSU and SPD, which is intended to serve as the working foundation for the future government. 

The word "queer" appears only twice in the 144-page document. 
At the same time, the implementation of the "Queer Leben" ("Queer Life") action plan, adopted by the traffic light coalition, and the continuation of the Federal Government Commissioner for the Acceptance of Sexual and Gender Diversity are more necessary than ever, especially in light of the rising number of cases of documented hate-based violence against LGBTQ+ individuals throughout Germany. 
The decision to conduct an additional expert review of the "Self-Determination Act" also raises concerns.


“The Coalition Agreement must not put the lives of queer refugees at risk,” says Anna Saib, head of the Quarteera counselling centre. 
“There must be legal and safe pathways into Germany for all queer individuals fleeing war, persecution, and anti-LGBTQ+ violence in their home countries. 
We are also highly critical of labelling countries such as Georgia as ‘safe countries of origin’ in the context of LGBTQ+ rights. 
We primarily provide support to LGBTQ+ refugees who have suffered as a result of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine or who have fled persecution and violence in their countries of origin. 
As a particularly vulnerable group, they must not fall victim to this intensified migration policy.”


It is deeply troubling that migration policy measures are mentioned in the same section as combating terrorism and crime. 
LGBTQ+ refugees are considered a particularly vulnerable group. 
“It is essential that counselling services — independent of bureaucracy and tailored to the needs of queer individuals — are provided on a permanent basis,” Saib emphasizes.
