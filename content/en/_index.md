Quarteera e. V. is the association of Russian-speaking LGBTQ* people and their friends. Since 2011, we have been advocating for the visibility of Russian-speaking LGBTQ* individuals in Germany, particularly among the Russian-speaking population, and promoting awareness of LGBTQ* issues among Russian-speaking people. Our mission is to counteract the multiple discrimination faced by Russian-speaking LGBTQ* individuals (due to their origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity).

We build a community, develop civil society, promote art, and engage in political education."
