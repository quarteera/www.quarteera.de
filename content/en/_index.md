Quarteera e. V. is a LGBTIQ\* nonprofit organization based in Germany, which has been advocating for the rights of LGBTIQ\* refugees and migrants from Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus since 2011. 

We support LGBTIQ\* refugees and migrants by providing assistance as they navigate their new lives in Germany and by raising awareness of the multiple discrimination they face. 

Therefore it is crucial to us to establish and defend queer communities, promote arts and culture, as well as to engage in the field of political education.
