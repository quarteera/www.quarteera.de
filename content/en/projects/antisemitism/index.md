## Why This Matters
We work within Russian-speaking migrant communities in Germany to counter antisemitism and queerphobia, creating safe
cultural and educational spaces where Jewish and LGBTQ+ identities are not just tolerated, but valued. Our approach
comes from within the community ‚Äî in its own language, with cultural competence and deep contextual understanding.

Antisemitism and queerphobia are often intertwined, reinforced by old myths, and justified as 'traditional values'.
We work to break this cycle.

**82%** of LGBTQ+ Jews face rejection in queer spaces after October 7, 2023.
