## Project Title: Development of Student Queer Movements in Russia

**Duration**: 01.08.2021 - 31.12.2021

**Participating Partners:** Various LGBTQ* organizations from different regions of Russia.

**Funding:** Federal Foreign Office of Germany within the framework of the Civil Society Cooperation Program to support and develop civil society in the countries of the "Eastern Partnership" and Russia.
This project is a continuation of the project “Raising Awareness about LGBTQ at Universities in Russia,” which was implemented by Quarteera in 2020 in cooperation with the Yekaterinburg Resource Center for LGBTQ*.

## Project Goals:

* Exchange of experiences on the establishment and functioning of queer groups at universities
* Creation of support opportunities for queer groups at universities in Russia, including the involvement of other partners and EU funding
* Strengthening the positions of local queer groups
* Educational work on-site at Russian universities
* Enabling dialogue between queer students

## Project Results:

Quarteera conducted three hybrid training events for Russian partners. The main topics were project management in international cooperation, funding opportunities from European funds, as well as the history and experiences of queer student representatives in Germany.

Numerous online meetings were held with partners to exchange ideas, information, and experiences and to solve problems together.
The partners conducted eleven educational events and one study.

The partners were trained on how to organize effective and safe events via Zoom. Quarteera offers its partners access to a special Zoom partner account with extended features for the entire year 2022.

Close personal and working relationships were established between the partners, enabling them to continue working together on the development of the queer student movement in Russia. The target groups of our partners have expanded significantly.
The foundations for further projects within this and other objectives have been created.
