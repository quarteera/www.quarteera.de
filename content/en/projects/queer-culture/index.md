## Application Deadline: 12.08.2024

## Grant Amount: 1,000 to 5,000 euros


{{< button link="https://forms.gle/98ubDWFPTmX8fTycA" color="green">}} Apply! {{< /button >}}

In the last two years, many queer artists from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine have been forced to leave their homelands. War, repression, and discrimination have driven them to seek safety in other countries, where they now face new problems, challenges, and discoveries.

Quarteera e.V., with the support of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the framework of the Civil Society Cooperation program, invites queer artists in exile to participate in this grant competition for cultural projects.

## Goals
We aim to preserve alternative culture, promote cultural exchange, and foster mutual understanding between queer refugees and the host society.

This grant is intended to support artists who express their experiences as queer refugees in their works, in order to:

* Demonstrate the variety of queer refugees’ life paths and cultures.
* Highlight the experiences of queer artists working in exile.
* Support queer artists and amplify their voices.

**Your experiences — whether positive, negative, or extraordinary — and your voice are important to us. We want you to be heard, understood, and accepted in your new countries. Your artwork will also serve as a source of support for others.**
**Your voice can make a difference!**

## Q&A

### Application Process

{{< collapse title="**Who can apply?**" color="green">}}

Queer refugees from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine with previous cultural and artistic experience are eligible to participate.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**Can I submit multiple applications?**" color="green">}}

You can submit only one application per kind of art. One person or group cannot receive financing for more than one project.
If you have two new projects of different art kinds, you can submit both. Please prioritize quality over quantity in your applications. The jury will assess the artistic value of the projects first and foremost.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**Can I participate if I emigrated more than 2 years ago?**" color="green">}}

Yes, you can, but priority will be given to recent queer refugees. However, this is not the only or main selection criterion. The relevance of your project to the competition’s topic and goals is the most important factor.
{{< /collapse >}}


{{< collapse title="**Can I submit my application in my native language?**" color="green">}}

To ensure timely assessment, applications are limited to these languages only - Russian (the organization’s functional language) and English (the most commonly used language).
{{< /collapse >}}


{{< collapse title="**What if I meet all the criteria but reside outside Germany and the Eastern Partnership countries?**" color="green">}}

This competition is designed to support queer refugees residing in the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova) or Germany. We understand that creative groups may be spread globally and people often change their country of residence. Some expenses incurred outside the listed countries can be covered (e.g., a fee for a group member in another country or a travel ticket to one of the listed countries for them). However, all project events must take place in one of the listed countries. Material purchases or space rentals are only possible in the listed countries. We can only sign a cooperation agreement with an individual applicant or a group representative residing in one of the listed countries.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**Is it possible to receive financing if I reside in Russia or Belarus?**" color="green">}}

Unfortunately, we cannot transfer money to Belarus or Russia due to legal reasons.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**What does the financing range of 1,000 to 5,000 euros mean? Who determines the actual amount?**" color="green">}}

Your application must include a financial plan for the project. Necessary financing varies among projects. For example, filming production costs differ from those for recording a song. If all selected projects have similar production costs, financing will be shared equally. Otherwise, the jury will distribute funds proportionally based on project needs.
