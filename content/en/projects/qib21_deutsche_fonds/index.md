Russian NGOs and action groups working on LGBTQ+ issues can receive funding from German foundations for their projects. Where and how can you apply for grants? Below are some practical tips and recommendations based on the experiences of Quarteera activists.

### **Step One: Decide whether you want to implement your project independently or in collaboration with a German organization.**
This will determine what type of grant you can expect.

Some organizations **only** fund projects in partnership with a German organization. The most important ones include:

- The **German Foreign Ministry** ([Auswärtiges Amt](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/)), which, for example, funded the project "Development of the Queer Student Movement in Russia," where Quarteera e.V. represented the German side and student groups from Russia represented the Russian side.

- **[Erasmus+](https://www.erasmusplus.de/)**, funded by the European Union, meaning that the partner country does not have to be Germany but can be any other EU member state.
- The **[Foundation for West-Eastern Encounters](https://www.stiftung-woeb.de/)**.
- **The "Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future" Foundation** ([EVZ Foundation](https://www.stiftung-evz.de/)).
- **Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations** ([ifa](https://www.ifa.de/en/)).

The level of German involvement varies. Some projects are primarily initiated and carried out by the German side, while others are designed and developed by the Russian side, with Germany providing support.

There are also structures that fund independent Russian projects (a partner country is not required), such as:
- **Rosa Luxemburg Foundation** ([Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung](https://www.rosalux.de/)), which has branches in many countries, including Russia.
- **Heinrich Böll Foundation** ([Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung](https://www.boell.de/en)), which has a representative office in Russia.

Additionally, you can apply for STEP Travel Grants or Travel Grants from the Goethe Institute for travel funding required to achieve your goals.

- Even a formally unregistered group or initiative can apply for a grant. Funders are aware of the legal obstacles to queer activism in Russia and take this into account.

### **Step Two: Find a suitable grant and don’t miss the application deadline.**
Each organization has its own procedures. For instance, the Foreign Ministry has regular programs and allocates a specific budget each year for projects aimed at developing democratic societies in Eastern Partnership countries and Russia. In contrast, the "Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future" Foundation has different programs and deadlines each time. We recommend subscribing to foundation mailing lists or regularly checking their websites to stay updated on new funding opportunities.

Grant applications are usually reviewed in two stages. After initial approval, the organization must submit a detailed proposal, which requires time to prepare.

Be prepared for delays in funding decisions. For example, approval for a project planned for January might not come until August. In such cases, it may be possible to obtain prior approval from the funder and agree to start the project before signing the final contracts (a strong justification is needed). **Do not start a project on your own risk!** The costs might not be reimbursed.

*Some application forms include the question "Do you plan to start the project in advance?" Be sure to check this box if applicable.*

### **Step Three: Fill out the application form correctly.**
No matter how creative your project is, it's crucial to follow the formalities. Most foundations have their own templates and guidelines. The Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, for example, also accepts informal applications. However, every application must include essential components.

The most important aspect is the **project description**—it must be interesting and original. Additionally, explain why your project is necessary and support this with evidence (e.g., specific events, media coverage). Describe the project goals, how it will be implemented, its target audience, timeframe, success criteria, and budget.

In most cases, you are expected to contribute financially as a partner organization. This should not discourage you—the amount may be small, but funders see it as proof of your commitment and involvement.

Most foundations only cover expenses directly related to the project. They do not fund general operational costs of an organization.

Throughout the project, **document all expenses carefully**. Funders require detailed financial reports. Based on Quarteera’s experience, reporting is slightly easier when funds come directly from institutions like the Foreign Ministry, compared to programs that receive budgets and then allocate them to projects.

- **It is recommended to include a risk assessment in your application.** Funders are aware of Russia's political situation. Some LGBTQ+ organizations cannot openly advertise events or use logos. However, German funders need to know how you will handle unforeseen circumstances. Mention in your application that if a participant faces legal prosecution, the budget will be adjusted to cover legal assistance.

- You can apply to multiple foundations simultaneously, with each covering part of the project.

- If a foundation has a representative office in Russia, the application can be submitted in Russian. Otherwise, documentation and communication must be in English or German, depending on the foundation's requirements.
