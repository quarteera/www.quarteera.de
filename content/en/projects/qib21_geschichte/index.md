## Queer Student Representatives in Germany: History and Context ##

Every German university has an official representation or office that deals with the interests of queer students. These offices are integrated into general university structures, taken seriously at all levels, and their existence is no longer surprising. In 2021, the first gay student representative office at a German university celebrated its 40th anniversary.

### Sex in the City
In 1921, Berlin hosted the "First International Conference for Sexual Reform on a Scientific Basis," attended by participants from various countries. They founded the World League for Sexual Reform and drafted a 10-point manifesto, including points such as the decriminalization of homosexual relationships, legalization of abortion, gender equality, and freedom in marriage and divorce. At the time, this organization was considered very progressive, addressing social issues that, in many cases, remain relevant today.

**Context:** At that time, Germany enforced "Paragraph 175," a penal code article criminalizing sexual relations between men. In 1921, 425 people were convicted under this law. Meanwhile, in the USSR, there were no legal consequences for homosexual relationships, as the corresponding law had been abolished after the October Revolution. Soviet marriage and private life laws were among the world's most progressive. The fifth conference of the World League was planned for Moscow in 1931 but was canceled due to political tensions.

Berlin had more gay-friendly establishments at the time than today, and the German LGBT organization "Bund für Menschenrecht" had 50,000 members—ten times more than today’s "Lesben- und Schwulenverband in Deutschland" (LSVD).

### "Through Science to Justice"

This was the motto of the Institute for Sexual Science, active in Berlin at the time. Founded by Prof. Magnus Hirschfeld, who also convened the League for Sexual Reform, the institute conducted research on sexuality-related topics. It offered specialized healthcare, surgeries, legal counseling, public lectures, and peer-to-peer support groups. The institute was a hub for freedom and experimentation.

Magnus Hirschfeld was the only researcher in Europe studying inter- and transsexuality. He coined the term "transvestite." He was a regular at the Eldorado Bar, often dressed in women’s clothing, earning him the affectionate nickname "Aunt Magnesia."

**Context:** Russia, January 15, 1921. The criminal police arrested 95 "partially women-dressed" men at a staged wedding in Petrograd. Many were military personnel. The event was a drag show gathering. The participants were suspected of "counterrevolutionary activities" but were eventually released.

### Nothing Personal

Germany, 1933: Hitler introduced the concept of "Gleichschaltung," a process of total ideological alignment without pluralism or individuality. Under this policy, organizations representing civil society interests were dismantled, including the Institute for Sexual Science. Military and police forces stormed the building, destroyed its archives, and burned its books on Berlin’s Opernplatz (now Bebelplatz) along with works of "anti-German" authors.

**Context:** Russia, 1933. Stalin ordered the introduction of criminal penalties for "pederasty." The law came into effect in 1934 and remained until 1993, when Boris Yeltsin repealed it. The law was actively enforced, with hundreds of people imprisoned annually.

### Organizations over Organizations
Germany, 1949: Post-war West Germany adopted the Basic Law, whose Article 20 states, "All state authority emanates from the people." This meant that civil society could now form organizations to represent its interests. The state recognized a strong civil society as a safeguard against totalitarianism. As a result, unions, associations, clubs, and free groups flourished, totaling around 600,000 today. These range from sugar collectors’ clubs to left-handed associations and laughter yoga groups.

This development also influenced university structures, granting them self-governance. University presidents were elected rather than appointed, and student representatives gained a voice in faculty policies. Offices for women's rights, later including lesbian rights, emerged.

**Context:** The West German government still upheld Nazi-era laws banning homosexual relations, and legal persecution of gay men continued.

### First Steps
Germany, 1981: The Free University of Berlin established the country’s first official gay student office. Activists outlined three main goals:

1. **Direct representation** of LGBTQ+ students' interests, including meeting spaces, LGBTQ-friendly medical contacts, housing assistance, social events, and support for university projects.
2. **Academic influence** by advocating for LGBTQ-related research, combating homophobia, and organizing public events.
3. **Political activism** beyond the university, fighting criminalization, employment discrimination, and state surveillance.

**Context:** In the 1980s, LGBTQ+ individuals were banned from several professions, primarily teaching and psychology. Until 1971, students discovered to be homosexual could be expelled from universities.

### Queer de Jure

Following Berlin’s lead, queer student offices emerged across Germany. Many informal activist groups already existed. Some gained recognition through protests, such as in Oldenburg, where gay students traditionally met at a university pool’s nudist day. When the day was banned, they protested.

**Context:** In 1980, activist Corny Littmann staged an exposé in Hamburg, smashing a mirror in a public toilet used for police surveillance of gay men. The widely publicized event helped dismantle Nazi-era "pink lists" tracking homosexuals.

### Queer for the World

Today, almost every German university has a queer office, typically part of student governance (AStA), with some funding and volunteer activists.

**Current initiatives of queer student offices include:**
- Counseling services
- Social events (parties, board games, etc.)
- Public lectures
- Participation in demonstrations and Pride events
- Advocacy for gender-inclusive restrooms and official name changes for trans students
