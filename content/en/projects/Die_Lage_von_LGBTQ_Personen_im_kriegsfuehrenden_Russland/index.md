**The Legal Situation of LGBTQ People in Wartime Russia**

Since the beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, hate campaigns against LGBTQ people in Russia have become a key factor in the militarization of everyday life in Russia and an instrument for the final destruction of civil society institutions and the rule of law.

This study is based on a legal analysis of two discriminatory laws against LGBTQ people that were enacted in Russia between 2022 and 2023: the "comprehensive ban on LGBT propaganda" and the ban on medical and legal gender transition for trans people. The analysis is supplemented by an overview of social and institutional discrimination practices against LGBTQ people from 2013 to 2023.

This highlights how these laws are part of a long process of totalizing society and preparing it for the abolition of the right to privacy and unlawful persecution. The study was conducted by the organization Quarteera e.V. with the support of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation.
