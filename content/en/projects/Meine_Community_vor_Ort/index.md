## Regional Development Project 'My Community on Site'

**Duration:** April 2023 - December 2023.

**Funding:** The project is funded by the Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future" (EVZ).

**Regions:** Dresden (Saxony), Hamburg, Cologne (NRW), Stuttgart (Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg)

**Project Manager:** Neko Panteleeva (no pronouns / \[she\]) regionen@quarteera.de

### Project Goals:
The goal of our project is to support newly arrived queer individuals in establishing their own groups in their places of residence and developing and offering activities that meet the needs of their respective members.

Quarteera e.V. supports these initiative groups in the regions through seminars and workshops on topics such as project and community work as well as the basics of civic engagement in Germany. Additionally, Quarteera e.V. promotes volunteers in the regions in developing and implementing small local projects tailored to the needs of their specific community.

### Public Significance of the Project:
Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, thousands of LGBTQ* individuals from Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian Federation have been forced to leave their countries, with many seeking refuge in Germany. Quarteera e.V. is the only nationwide organization in Germany whose target group consists of queer people who communicate in Russian, making it a primary point of contact. Until now, Quarteera e.V. has only been able to offer counseling services and personal exchange opportunities in community centers in Berlin.

Through increasing contact with Russian-speaking refugees and migrants across Germany, it is becoming increasingly clear how essential it is to have a community in a familiar language on-site, as well as an exchange with people who have had similar experiences. Some need guidance, while others are experienced activists from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia who want to continue their activism in Germany and need support. Additionally, rediscovering a sense of belonging in a new place and connecting with the queer community can be a crucial support in times of change.

### We Need Your Help:
Get in touch with us if you live in one of the above-mentioned regions (or nearby) and want to be part of the nationwide development of a transnational migrant queer community. Contact us if you want to support your local group and develop activities that your community members need.

Together, we can create spaces of queer migrant visibility in uncertain times, bringing help, support, and a bit of security into a new life in new places.
