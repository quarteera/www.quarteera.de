Against the backdrop of political instability in the Eastern Partnership countries, LGBTQ+ communities are increasingly becoming targets of media manipulation and hostile rhetoric. At the same time, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Moldova have in recent years become new homes for many queer people from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia — people seeking safety and freedom.
Our response to the use of LGBTQ+ issues to divide societies is cultural resistance — built on mutual support and shared knowledge.

**We are launching a Lab to bring together artists, content creators, researchers, curators, and other cultural professionals whose creative work breaks stereotypes and helps build common ground to counter disinformation.**

## About the Lab

A professional group of eight queer cultural practitioners will be selected through an open call. We invite artists living in **Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Germany**, as well as people who have relocated to these countries from **Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia**.

Over the course of a year, participants will share experiences, support each other, develop joint strategies against propaganda and fake news, and create new artistic works to confront queer-related disinformation in their countries.

The program includes regular online sessions, an in-person meeting in one of the countries of the region, mentoring by experts, and up to €5,000 in funding per project.

The Lab will culminate in a Cultural Festival in Berlin in November 2026, where the works created will be publicly presented.

The project is implemented by **Quarteera e.V.**, with financial support from the **German Federal Foreign Office** through the programme “Expanding Cooperation with Civil Society in the Eastern Partnership Countries and Russia”.

### Participating in the Lab and Realizing Your Project

{{< collapse title="**Can I create my project in my native language?**" color="green">}}
It’s important to us that your work is understood by people affected by anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
You can work in the language of the country where you live – or in the language that best helps you communicate your message to your audience.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**What happens if I cannot finish my project?**" color="green">}}
Before the Lab begins, we will sign an agreement with each participant outlining the mutual obligations. Quarteera cannot pay fees for unfinished work.
Funds for incomplete projects will need to be returned.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**What happens to my project after it’s finished?**" color="green">}}
We want your project to live on and reach as many people as possible.
If you have further plans for promotion or presentation — even better! We are happy to work with you to develop a distribution strategy.
Your work can be featured at Quarteera events and used in educational or awareness-raising contexts.
The Lab also offers opportunities for international presentations.
{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse title="**Who will hold the copyright to my project?**" color="green">}}
The artist grants Quarteera e.V. non-exclusive rights to use the work created during the Lab. This means both you and Quarteera can present and distribute the work independently.
Please note: due to the nature of the grant, we cannot delay public presentation of the works (e.g., for festival premieres).
Public outreach is a core element of the Lab.
