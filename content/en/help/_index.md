We help queer refugees and migrants from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus with arriving and orienting themselves in Germany.


* We provide legal advice on asylum and residence law, assist with German bureaucracy, and offer guidance on social topics such as social benefits, health, employment, education, and housing search.

* We offer psychosocial support for initial orientation in Germany as well as crisis counseling for LGBTIQ* individuals experiencing acute stress and challenges.

* We assist LGBTIQ* individuals affected by queerphobic discrimination and violence and advocate for their rights.

* We support individuals with the German language and communication with German authorities and other relevant actors.

* We provide information on migration and asylum in Germany. We also inform and advise LGBTIQ* activists and journalists from Russia about humanitarian visas to Germany.
