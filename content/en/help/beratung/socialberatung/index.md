We can help you if you:

* Need support with applications and forms; or
* Require assistance in communicating with German authorities (e.g., Jobcenter, Social Welfare Office, Immigration Office, etc.).

You can **come without an appointment** during the first hour of consultation hours. After that, only with an appointment.

## Accompaniment and Language Mediation

Do you have an appointment with an authority, a medical facility, or have been invited to sign a rental contract, but you do not speak or understand German well?

Quarteera e.V. can help you find a volunteer to accompany you and provide language mediation in Berlin. Please send a request in advance to help@quarteera.de and provide all necessary information (When, Where, Type of Appointment, Languages You Speak, and Your Contact Details).

Do you live outside Berlin? We can assist you in finding a language mediator in your region or, if necessary and possible, provide a telephone language mediation service.

Please note that we cannot guarantee accompaniment and language mediation as we rely on volunteer support.
