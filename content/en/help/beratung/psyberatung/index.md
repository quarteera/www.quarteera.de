## Psychosocial Initial Consultation

The psychosocial consultation is a half-hour conversation with a psychological counselor aimed at determining the best next step for improving your mental health and exploring the professional support options available to you.

You can reach out to us,
* if you are in a difficult life situation and have not yet had a consultation with us.
* or if you haven't had time to focus on your mental health because you've been dealing with bureaucratic or personal problems.
* if you want to take care of yourself but donâ€™t know where to start. Your questions may range from "What is wrong with me?" to "How can I find a psychotherapist?"

Please note that our counseling service is not psychotherapy. To schedule an appointment, please send us an email at help@quarteera.de.
