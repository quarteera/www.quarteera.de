## We provide information and advice on all matters related to asylum and residence in Germany. We inform you about your rights and obligations.

{{< figure src="/images/beratung/rechtsberatung.png" class="page-image" caption="">}}

As part of an individual consultation, you will discuss your legal situation and questions with our advisors. You can reach out to our advisors if you have questions regarding your residence status, asylum procedure, family reunification, or similar matters.

We assist you with applications and can actively support you in communicating with authorities.

Please have all relevant documents from official offices (authorities, lawyers, etc.) ready when attending a consultation.

In certain cases, it is also possible for us to take over your legal representation before authorities and courts. Whether we can take on your case is a decision that must be made individually.
