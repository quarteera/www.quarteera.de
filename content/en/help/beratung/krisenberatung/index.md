## Crisis Counseling

You can receive free psychosocial support from us in the form of 1 to 5 counseling sessions.

You can reach out to us if you have recently experienced a difficult or distressing situation, such as:
* Violence in a relationship (partner, parent-child, work relationship, etc.)
* Sexualized violence or exploitation;
* Escape or political emigration.

If your condition has worsened recently, if you find it harder to cope with daily life, or if your usual methods of stress management no longer work â€“ write to us at **help@quarteera.de**, and we will try to help you.

Please note that our counseling service is not psychotherapy. Our counselors can help you find long-term psychotherapy in Germany if needed.
