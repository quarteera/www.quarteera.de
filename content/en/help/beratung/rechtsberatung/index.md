## What is Discrimination?

The General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual identity in the areas of employment and everyday business transactions. Everyday transactions include discrimination in the housing market, access to medical practices, or even membership in fitness studios.

LGBTIQ\* individuals with refugee or migration backgrounds may experience multiple discrimination. This means that a person can face a specific form of discrimination due to multiple coexisting factors, such as sexual orientation or gender identity combined with ethnic origin.

Victims can take action against such discrimination. They may be entitled to claim damages and compensation. Additionally, they can demand that ongoing discrimination be stopped (right to removal) and prevented in the future (right to injunction).

It is important to note that claims must be asserted within two months of becoming aware of the discrimination.

Further cases of violence may be prosecuted under criminal law.
