This section contains information about the rules and possibilities of migration from Ukraine and other countries for LGBTQ+ individuals.

Quarteera is a volunteer organization of Russian-speaking lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans*, and queer people living in Germany. Among our activists are people from various Post-Soviet countries: Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, etc. We were deeply shaken by the military invasion of Ukraine and could not remain indifferent. We help LGBTQ+ individuals from Ukraine who are fleeing to Germany.
