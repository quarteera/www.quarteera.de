Quarteera operates both continuously and on a project basis.

We organize:
- Regular events at our center in Berlin to bring the community together. For example, every first Friday of the month, we hold the traditional Kvartirnik – Quarteera's community gathering;
- Together with our partners, we host lectures and discussions at the Berlin PANDA Theater, the Waldschlösschen Academy, and other locations;
- Since 2020, we have organized the [Marzahn Pride](https://www.marzahn-pride.de/) in the Berlin district of Marzahn.

We also carry out projects in collaboration with LGBTQ* organizations from post-Soviet countries.

Quarteera's ongoing offerings include counseling provided by social workers, lawyers, and psychologists.

Quarteera is a volunteer-based organization. Therefore, all our activities rely on your support. We need your ideas, information, skills, time, and donations.

You can become a member of Quarteera, a volunteer, a donor, or participate in our projects on a freelance basis. In this section, you will learn how you can support us.
